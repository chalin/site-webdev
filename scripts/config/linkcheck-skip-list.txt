# Temporary as we transition to angular_router 2:
/api/angular_router/angular_router/Route-class
/api/angular_router/angular_router/(ROUTER_DIRECTIVES|ROUTER_PRIMARY_COMPONENT|ROUTER_PROVIDERS)

# Temporary as we transition to AngularDart 4 and docs under the doc repo folder:
.*/go/angular-dart-docs/

# angular.io is now an Angular app; the link checker has difficulty seeing anchors
# (probably because the page hasn't been fully generated yet), so skip such links:
https://angular.io/[^#]*#

# Ignore warnings about missing anchors into the live example apps:
http://angular-examples.github.io/[^/]+/?#

# Sites using hash location strategy or anchors instead of query params.
# Hence linkcheck issues a warning about the missing "anchor". Silence these:
http://caniuse.com/#
https://groups.google.com/a/dartlang.org/forum/#

# Link placeholders
